ASDA is a forum for public discussion, debate, and criticism of the Department of Agriculture's technical officers' research output (DOA).Technical knowledge encompasses a broad range of topics and functions (research, extension, seed and planting material production and certification, plant protection and quarantine, education and training). ASDA encourages future end-users to adopt emerging technologies quickly. Innovative methods proposed by media experts and other service providers, which are not often specifically linked to science, are given due credit.


On two consecutive days, two parallel technical sessions and a poster presentation will be held. A session will consist of 4-5 15-minute presentations with a 5-minute discussion following each presentation. The presentations made available are published in the Sri Lanka Department of Agriculture's annals. All presenters receive monetary prizes. The Best Scientist (a gold medal), Best Young Scientist, three outstanding non-science contributors, and the best research paper each receive six cash awards.


Objectives

To provide a forum for Department of Agriculture officers to present and share their technical expertise with other members of the scientific community as well as those involved in agricultural development in the country, for mutual benefit.

To publicize the Department of Agriculture's officers' new jobs.
